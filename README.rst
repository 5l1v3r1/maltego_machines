Maltego Machines
================

Maltego machines help automate the work that gets done inside of Paterva's Maltego product. Machines can run several transforms at once or be setup to run specific tasks at regular intervals. This repository is meant to hold Maltego machines related to PassiveTotal to improve analyst workflows and speed up the investigative process.
